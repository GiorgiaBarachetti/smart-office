# Material UI - Create React App example in TypeScript

## How to use
Install or clone the repository
```sh
https://github.com/GiorgiaBarachetti/smart-office
```

Then run:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use Material UI with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript).
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), the default style engine in Material UI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/templates/) section.
